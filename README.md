# RedisProtocolGenerator
Simple script to implement RESP (REdis Serialization Protocol)

This project features an utility to serialise Redis commands according
to RESP. I have used this script on some occasions when needed to do
mass insertions as described on https://redis.io/topics/mass-insert.

This project also illustrates how to insert/retrieve data in JSON format
to/from Redis.
